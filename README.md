# Not yet, AV1 #  
  
This is extremely lightweight Chrome plugin to disable AV1 on YouTube and other sites.  

I believe that AV1 is still very green format and can't be played 4k60fps without hardware support.  
  
Fundamentally this is [h264ify](https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify) by [erkserkserks](https://github.com/erkserkserks), but without options and h264-only restriction.
